# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

這是一個提供點子的表單，主要徵求的是「內部直播」與「講座」的建議，其實初步我們比較想徵求的是直播內容有關的提案，隨著提案越多，越可以統整出類型相同的主題，這樣就更可以做出系列型的主題分享，比方說一個月4次的跟"投資"有關的主題。

每次直播都會建議至少是兩個人的，一主一副，主要的人會承擔八成以上內容分享，副手則比較偏聆聽者的角色，會負責回應講者或讀出問題或加強提問。這樣也可以不至於單人那麼疲累。

由於我們不希望是無效的提議，所以必須記名提案。這樣也方便我們在日後可以隆重感謝你的點子。

我們也有規劃，日後把這個表單形式改成瀏覽與操作方便的網頁，豐富這個優良的互動生態。

所以在這個表單你必須提供，
1.你是誰
2.提案主題，3到10字都可以
3.推薦主講人
4.推薦講者夥伴

非常感謝你。
